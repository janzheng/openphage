# Open Phage Data Sheet

Visit the site here: https://open.phage.directory

This project is a public-facing, collaborativeGoogle Sheet project that collects information for various aspects in the phage academia space, like tools, grants, and clinical trials. 

Collecting these links is currently user-generated, but once various resources are setup and listed (e.g. PubMed, clinicaltrials.gov) we can start automating the process.

The code in this repo is a simple backend and wrapper to pull data from the Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fhBigiisdCc8-YWD4K8U6yvXK47p67KzA7JfAWsh-Iw/edit#gid=818998992

Built with Hono (https://hono.dev/getting-started/cloudflare-workers) and deployed on Cloudflare Workers.

The Google Sheet "API" was made possible with [SpreadAPI](https://spreadapi.roombelt.com/setup), which is a free Google App Script that sets it up as a REST endpoint. This code uses Cloudflare Workers KV for caching.
